# :star: Features

[(Back to top)](#performance-react)

This is a project built for a study on performance in ReactJS. It simulates a
long list of information and how you can perform on it.

Some key features are:

- Functional application with ReactJS.
- Dynamic load.
- Lazy load.
- React Memo.
- UseCallback.
- Written using Typescript.

The application is built using ReactJS. Data is provided by a fake API using JSON
Server. It uses many React concepts for enhance performance. The entire codebase
is written using Typescript.

> Project developed at Chapter V of Rocketseat's Ignite bootcamp.
